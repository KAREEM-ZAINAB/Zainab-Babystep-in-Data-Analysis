# Findings and recommendations
Noticed the government and small business owners have the highest discounts given to them. This dosent have a bad effect on profit or sales as discount is highly correlated to sales. So an increase in discount will cause no harm whatsoever to sales and profit.

The product Paseo has the highest number of product sold with  $28,213,706.00 

VTT has the highest number of cost of production(manufacturing price) in 2013 and 2014.
